# Crypto Forecasting with Quantum Machine Learning
This repository contains several (quantum) machine learning algorithms to predict cryptocurrency prices. 
## Overview
### Data

### Libraries
Libraries used include:
* PennyLane
* Torch
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
  
## Algorithms

## TODO
### Priority 
* [ ] change square loss function / other loss function to be same / interpret them the same WED
* [ ] update model to be recurrent WED
* [ ] verify and/or improve preprocessing WED 
   - [ ] invert y fitting 
   - [ ] X fitting? 
* [ ] try more cnns/q combinations  WED 
* [ ] create graph with y_test and several y_preds WED 
* [ ] change up gates in self made circuit and/or make recurrent WED
* [ ] clean up code THUR 
* [ ] write readme THUR
* [ ] write 2-paragraph proposal for braket credits by WED 
* [ ] run on braket simulater WED 
* [ ] run on braket qpu THUR 
* [ ] submit by THUR 

### Nice to Have
* [ ] implement Bausch QRNN WED
* [ ] implement classical LSTM WED
* [ ] try with more cryptocurrencies 
* [ ] try with different y_col's 
* [ ] try to figure out close - including current open
* [ ] drop layers in cnn
